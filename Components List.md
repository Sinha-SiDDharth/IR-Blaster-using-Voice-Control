## Components List

### 1. **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- Acts as the **central controller** of the system.  
- Comes with *inbuilt Wi-Fi* to process `HTTP` requests.  
- Executes IR signal transmissions based on *voice commands* via the **HTTP Shortcuts** app.

### 2. **IR Transmitter Module (`Vishay TSOP38238`)**
- Sends precise **infrared signals** to target devices.  
- Emulates *remote control* actions like **power**, **volume**, etc.

### 3. **Jumper Wires (Male-to-Male)**
- Used for **quick and temporary** electrical connections.  
- Great for *breadboarding* and prototyping.

### 4. **Resistors**
- Regulate **current flow** to protect components.  
- Maintain *voltage stability* and prevent **component damage**.
